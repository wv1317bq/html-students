Repository for practicing working with git. 

Introduce yourself via a `USERNAME.yml` file under the appropriate [`_data/TERM_YEAR/`](_data/) directory, and submit via pull request. See [the example file](_data/summer_2015/htcmosman.json), and replace with your own `name`, `emoji` (see [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)), and `introduction`.
